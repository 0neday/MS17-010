# MS17-010
As all of our research is now in Metasploit master repository, there was no reason to confuse everyone by keeping this repo open as there were two versions of everything and support became a nightmare.

Those searching for the scanners:

- Metasploit: https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010
- Python: https://github.com/nixawk/labs/blob/master/MS17_010/smb_exploit.py

Those searching for the stripped down EternalBlue:

Windows kernel shellcode will be in Metasploit as well as submitted to exploit-db when x86 version is completed.
